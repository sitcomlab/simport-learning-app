Map tiles are the background images you see when looking at a map, consisting for example of roads in a city. Requests for map tiles sent by the Simport learning app to CARTO include your device’s IP address as well as the region for which data is requested. Please refer to <a href='https://carto.com/privacy//'>https://carto.com/privacy/</a> for information on how CARTO processes this data.<br><br>Second, in order to convert a location represented by latitude and longitude into an address (a process known as “reverse geocoding”), the App uses the OpenStreetMap Foundation’s Nominatim service. Reverse geocoding is used in the app to display addresses for locations that inference suggests might be significant in your life. Requests for reverse geocoding sent by the App to Nominatim include your device’s IP address as well as the GPS coordinates of the location for which the address is requested. Please refer to <a href='https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy'>https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy</a>  for information on how Nominatim processes this data. To provide some obfuscation, with every real request we include requests for three randomized locations within a radius of five kilometers.<br><br>The App does not share or disclose any data with any other party.",
